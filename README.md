## Purpose of the code
On busy work days, there’s never enough time - different tasks can be time and energy consuming. One thing that can help students overcome the hardship of the work day is coffee, but making it can be a hindrance in regards to dealing with other time requirements. We seek to deal with this coffee-making task by automating the process of the coffee machine. This can be done in many ways but we delve into creating a device that's connected to the user's coffee machine, and which will host a webpage locally, making it possible for the user to boot up their coffee machine remotely - be it from across the globe or just from the bedroom. This prototype is realised using an ESP32 chip in conjunction with a relay that will control the flow of electricity thereby turning the coffee machine on and off.
